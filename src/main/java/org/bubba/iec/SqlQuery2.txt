I'm assuming the OrderItem table has a key to the orderNumber field in the Order table.

select o.orderNumber 
  from mydb.order o 
    where o.orderNumber =
	(select oi.orderNumber
           from orderNumber oi
	    join item i on oi.key = i.key
	    group by oi.orderNumber
            having sum(i.price * oi.quantity) > 100);
